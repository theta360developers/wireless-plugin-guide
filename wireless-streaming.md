You must have the Ricoh Desktop Application installed on your 
computer.  If you do not have the desktop application installed,
download it from 
[https://theta360.com/en/support/download/](https://theta360.com/en/support/download/)

### Reboot camera

To be safe, reboot the camera. A reboot may not be needed in some cases, but
if you have time, hold the power key down for 8 seconds. Once the camera
has turned off, press the power button again. 

Be careful not to do a short press of the power button, 
which places the camera into sleep mode and will not reboot the camera.


### Configure THETA V to Connect to Internet

The objective of this step is to configure your
THETA V to connect to the Internet using Client Mode Wi-Fi.
In Client Mode, the Wi-Fi LED on the front of the camera is solid
green.

If you have already configured your camera with Client Mode, you can 
skip this step.

Continue on if you do not have a green LED as shown in the picture below.

There is a more detailed guide for Client Mode configure [here](https://community.theta360.guide/t/theta-v-client-mode-configuration-guide/2565?u=codetricity).

Most routers have a mode called, "WPS", which stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup. This will 
enable you to connect your THETA V directly to your router with a few button presses.

#### WPS Setup

Hold your THETA V and press the Wi-Fi, Mode, and Shutter buttons down.

On your Wi-Fi router, press the WPS button, usually on the back of the router.

The THETA V should now be configured for Client Mode. In the future, you can place the THETA V into 
Client Mode by press the Wi-Fi button on the side of the camera.

#### Manual Setup

If you do not have access to WPS on your router or you are connecting 
the camera to your mobile hotspot, please look at [this]((https://community.theta360.guide/t/theta-v-client-mode-configuration-guide/2565?u=codetricity)) configuration
guide for information on manual configuration.
